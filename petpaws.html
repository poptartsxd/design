          <p>To understand user needs, I conducted <b>9 interviews</b> with people who have adopted a pet from the shelter, bought a pet from the pet store, or considered getting a pet. I also visited nearby shelters to speak with adoption specialists. Some responses included:</p>
          <p class="vertical-divider"><i>"I don't know where to start finding information. I think it's too expensive and time-consuming to find a pet."</i><br>- Participant who had never adopted a pet before</p>
          <p class="vertical-divider"><i>"It's hard to find any information online. Looking at pictures is not enough."</i><br>- Participant who had adopted a dog before</p>
          <p class="vertical-divider"><i>"I've been thinking about getting a dog for years. I just don't know how to get started."</i><br>- Participant who had never adopted a pet before</p><br>
          <p>Based on my interviews, I created a map of the pet adoption process to help me identify user pain points. I categorized actions into <b>three phases</b>: Thinking/Researching, Visiting, and Getting Pet.</p>

          <br>
          <p>The majority of sites focus on starting the adoption process by having users submit an application online. However, in my interviews, participants saw the sites more as a means to get information.

          <p class="text-center section-subtitle">Design Guidelines</p>
          <p>Based on my insights, I decided to combine two of my ideas to create an Android app with AR capabilities. This was feasible within the allotted time and would have the most impact on users. I chose to design an app because it would give users <b>mobility and flexibility of use</b>. Some guidelines that I came up with include:</p>

          <p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should be able to see the pets that best fit their lifestyle</b></p>
          <p>Through machine learning, the app will display and update recommended pets based on the user's inputs and preferences. This will help users find the perfect pet for them.</p>

          <p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should be able to find relevant information</b></p>
          <p>The app will tailor what information is presented, such as estimated costs for each pet that the user is interested in. This helps the user find information that is important to them.</p>

          <p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should be able to see how the pet fits in their space</b></p>
          <p>Using Google's ARCore, PetPaws will display a 3D rendering of an animal similar to the pet in the user's home. From my interviews, pictures alone are not enough for users to visualize how the pet will look in their home. This feature helps users determine if they have space for the animal and also gives users a fun way to see their future pet.</p>

          <p class="vertical-divider"><b>The app must account for different levels of pet knowledge</b></p>
          <p>From talking to users, I found that people had varying levels of pet knowledge. Therefore, I made sure to account for these different types of users in my design.</p>

            <p>At first, I did not have the option for users to view all pets. They were limited to just what the app recommended. However, I found that users also wanted the flexibility to see all pets and scroll through all the pictures.</p>

            <p><b>Making "Schedule" a Floating Action Button</b></p>
            <p>I originally did not have a floating action button on the pet detail page. Instead, I used a flat button to schedule an appointment. However, when users were looking at this screen, a lot of them did not see "Schedule". As a result, I decided to turn that button into a floating action button to promote the action.</p>

            <p>Users were confused by the percentage match on the pet cards. They did not have a meaningful understanding of the percent values (e.g., the difference between "92% Match" and "75% Match"). I removed this feature and added a more relevant feature - displaying the pet's traits.</p>

            <p class="text-center section-subtitle">A VR Pet Shelter Experience</p>
            <p>In my interviews, I found that users really liked <b>being able to see a pet in-person so that they can see the pet's personality</b>. Because of this, I thought about using Google Daydream to create a VR experience where users could see how the pet interacts. Due to time constraints and feasibility, I decided not to pursue this route for the design challenge. However, if I had more time, I would like to prototype a VR shelter experience.</p><br>

            <p>Out of the 3 prompts, I chose this one because I love animals and it gave me an excuse to go to the shelter to play with dogs. I also thought it would be interesting to learn about how someone goes through the pet adoption process as I have never owned a pet before. </p><br>

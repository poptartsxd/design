        <p>When eating out with a group, splitting the check can be a real headache. Restaurants cannot always split the check for large parties, making it a hassle to figure out who ordered what. A common workaround is to have one person pay upfront and everyone else use a third-party service to pay the person back. However, the amount repaid may not be accurate and the person who foot the bill could feel too awkward to bring it up.</p>
        <p>Check is an iOS app that helps you and a group of people split a bill <b>efficiently and fairly</b>. It handles all the calculations, to make sure everyone feels that they paid their fair share.</p>

        <p class="text-center section-subtitle">Understanding the User</p>
        <p>To understand user needs, I conducted <b>6 interviews</b> that focused on asking people about their experience eating out with a group of friends and how they resolve paying the check at the end. Common responses include:</p>
        <p class="vertical-divider"><i>"I don't like to bother the waiter. It's hard to explain who ordered what."</i></p>
        <p class="vertical-divider"><i>"People don't always Venmo me the correct amount if I pay the check upfront. Then, I feel weird asking them for the extra $1. But it really adds up with a large group."</i></p>
        <p class="vertical-divider"><i>"When we split the check equally to not bother the waiter, I sometimes feel that I pay too much."</i></p><br>
        <p>Based on my interviews, I found that splitting check breaks down into two decisions:</p>
        <p>1. Do people want to split things evenly or unevenly?<br>
          2. Do people want to have everyone handle the payment now or have it made up at another time ("pay later")?</p>

          <p class="vertical-divider">Paying now with an uneven check split caused the <b>greatest hassle on waiters and users</b>. Users had to figure out who ordered what and had a hard time explaining to a waiter how to split the check.</p>
          <p class="vertical-divider">A lot of users did not want to bother the waiter so they would split the bill later by having one person in the group foot the bill. Unfortunately, this was usually done <b>after the meal</b> and when the bill is split unevenly, <b>users had trouble recalling and calculating the correct amount</b>.</p>

          <p>These tools have made it easy to send money to friends. However, even with these tools, I found that users would still have to go through the process of figuring out what they ordered, a process that is <b>time-consuming and prone to error</b>.</p>

          <p>Based on my insights, I decided to create a standalone app that would give users <b>mobility and flexibility of use</b>. When you are out at dinner, the most convenient device is your smartphone. Some guidelines that I came up with include:</p>

          <p class="vertical-divider"><b>App would focus on the "pay later" scenario where one user pays the bill upfront.</b></p>
          <p>The "pay now" scenario would require an integration with the restaurant's payment system, creating <i>high infrastructure restructuring costs</i> and potential <i>barriers to entry</i> with the restaurant. As a result, I focused on the "pay later" scenario that would be feasible.</p>


          <p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should be able to split bill and tip with multiple people.</b></p>
          <p><i>Benefit:</i> This will decrease any discomfort and awkwardness the person who usually pays has for reminding people to pay them back.</p>

          <p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should be able to see and select the food and drinks that they had ordered.</b></p>
          <p><i>Benefit:</i> This will help facilitate the process of figuring out who ordered what so that users won't have to recall what they ordered from memory.</p>

          <p class="vertical-divider"><b>App should be able to calculate the cost for users.</b></p>
          <p><i>Benefit:</i> This will decrease the chance for error when users are trying to pay someone back. This ensure fair and accurate payment.</p>

              <p>Throughout my process, I referred to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and made sure that design choices I made would suit iPhone users. I had the mentality of "native first, custom when needed".</p>

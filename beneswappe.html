					<p>BeneSwappe is an online clothing exchange service where groups of friends, coworkers, or classmates can come together to easily swap clothes they don't want anymore. Each year, more than 15 million tons of textile are wasted in the US alone. People feel too busy to try to find another owner for their unwanted clothing and will toss it out. While donating is a good option, very few donations actually make it into the hands of someone in need. This is where BeneSwappe comes in.</p>

						How it works
					</p>
					<p>For people who are too busy to find new owners for unwanted clothes, BeneSwappe is the solution. After cleaning their closets, users can upload unwanted items that they think a friend might want. Their friends can then pick and choose which items they want from a respository of unwanted clothes. Having a centralized location where you can list unwanted items to people you know increases the chance that the item will land in the hands of someone who wants it. Below are some features:</p>

					<p class="text-center section-subtitle">Research</p>
					<p>To understand user needs, I conducted 8 <b>semi-structured interviews</b> with people who have done clothing swaps before, or those who have cleaned their closets recently. I also <b>observed users</b> who were in the process of cleaning their closets. I found a repeated pattern in responses. Most users responded along the lines of:</p>
					<p class="vertical-divider"><i>"Sometimes I have to ask multiple friends before I find someone who wants my clothes."</i></p>
					<p class="vertical-divider"><i>"I don't always have the time to find someone who wants my clothes. I'll just throw it out or put it in donation."</i></p>
					<p class="vertical-divider"><i>"My friends and I will try to find the time to all come together to swap. It's easier to have everyone in the same place so we can see everyone else's clothes at the same time."</i></p><br>
					<p>Based on my interviews and observations, I conducted a <b>task analysis</b> of how a user cleans their closet and sort through their clothing. This helped me identify user pain points and areas where value was lost.</p>

					<p>From the companies that I looked at, these sites that offer the "free swap" functionality have trouble retaining traffic because <b>the degrees of separation is too high</b>.

					<p class="text-center section-subtitle">Design Guidelines</p>
					<p>Based on my research insights, I decided to create a place where groups of friends, coworkers, or classmates can come together to swap clothes. Below are some features that I came up with to include:</p>

					<p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should be able to access from any device (desktop or mobile)</b></p>
					<p>Because clothes swapping is not a daily activity, I decided against a mobile app. Instead, I decided to create a <i>responsive website</i>, giving users the option to use the site on their laptops or their phones.</p>
					<p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should be able to add their unwanted clothes to a central repository</b></p>
					<p>Allowing groups of people to add their unwanted clothing to a centralized location allows other members of the group to <i>browse items asynchronously, making swapping more efficient</i>.</p>
					<p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should be able to see items that other members have uploaded </b></p>
					<p>Having a location where you can list unwanted items <i>increases the chance </i>that the item will land in the hands of someone who wants it, thus generating value that would have otherwise been lost.</p>
					<p class="vertical-divider"><b>Users should only be able to swap within the group that they are part of</b></p>
					<p>Making the website group-based allows users to <i>feel more comfortable </i>swapping clothes rather than with strangers. While not everyone witin the group has to know everyone else, each person has to know at least one other person to be invited. This decreases the degree of separation.</p>

					<p>Using the design goals, I created the ideal <b>user flow</b> for someone like Tania and Alex would go through interacting with BeneSwappe. The two main tasks include: adding an item and requesting an item.</p>
					<p class="vertical-divider"><i>Tania is very busy and doesn't have the time to try to guess which friend wants her clothes.</i> Using BeneSwappe, Tania can upload her clothes at once and any of her friends can view it from the site.</p>
					<p class="vertical-divider"><i>Alex and her friends find it hard to coordinate swaps in person.</i> On BeneSwappe, Alex and her friends can browse all the clothes available from each other, so they don't have to coordinate to be at the same place at the same time.</p>

						<p class="text-center section-subtitle">My thoughts</p>
						<p>This project was based off another a nonprofit organization I started when I was in undergrad called BeneShoppe. We collected unwanted items from students and resold them on an online thrift store, then donating all profits to a charity.</p>
						<p>Now, 3 years later, coming up with the idea for BeneSwappe was really exciting. The most striking part was seeing the difference in my design work. Back in undergrad, I knew very little of design but I still made the logo and site anyways. Comparing the two shows how much I've grown and how much I can keep growing.</p><br>
						<p>One last quick note. I used this project as an opportunity to learn about motion design. Every prototype I created, I made sure to implement motion principles effectively. It is tough but I really enjoy it! I learned that sometimes storyboarding out the animation goes a long way (thank you Disney animation for teaching me that!).</p>
